1.1 Introduction
Data science is currently one of the most valued skills in the Marine Science field. This is often in the form of scripts within the Rstudio program, among others like Python and MatLAB. The ability to be able to gain an understanding into data to ask questions has grown alongside the advancements of technology and artificial intellegence within the last 10 years. I have said it before, but I'll say it again: The future is faster that we think!

To gain the skill in data science allows us to automate work flows, visualise data, share and combine data locally and globally through repositories and importantly allows our scripts and data analysis, to be reproduced in studies alike.

Gaining qualitative or quantitative data in the field, is in itself a vital aspect of science within any field. It is clear that when gathering data, a lot of aspects must be taken into account. The type of data collected, sample sizes, resources needed and how to best str

Gathering qualitative or quantitative data in the field is an essential aspect of scientific research across various disciplines. It involves careful consideration of multiple factors, including the type of data collected, sample sizes, required resources, and methodological approaches. This underscores the crucial role of data currency, where collected data not only meets scientific requirements but also translates into tangible impacts in the natural world. This is where data science plays a pivotal role, enabling the extraction of meaningful insights and trends from data sets to address pertinent questions and advance scientific understanding.

The workshop has a lot of theory based practice that is knowledge I hope to retain, so where things get wordy, that's just my way of saying "Hey! I want to remember this!"

A quick note on the formatting of the script: All sections will be referenced directly to their corresponding sections and subsections of the workflow module PDF. This means, that there might be spots where it jumps from one section to the next i.e 4.1 then 4.5 respectively. The sections numbers just help for reference to where I am at in the workbook, for my own reference and those who may be following along!

Let's get right into it... 
Starting a R markdown script:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
This first workshop, will be spent on building my base of scientific programmming skills in the context of making data analyses TRANSPARENT and REPRODUCIBLE.

Key takeaway: Putting into practice the abilityn to build rigorous programmed workflows and begin to put into practice, the methods for backing-up my code and implementing version control. This is important as it will teach me how best to support working collaboratively and encouraging open science principles within my own practice.

Now we can install packages that we need for the script and plots.
```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
remove.packages('rlang')
install.packages('rlang')
```
We'll jump back to this later when we start to build some plots using the built in data. 

For now.. I will repeat the steps I originally used to install Git (within R), Set up a GitHub account (the online aspect and repository sharing).
We have now learnt (and will learn to appreciate) the platform known as GitHub. The version control that the platform provides is robust with its version control capabilities, where data scientists can track changes to data sets, make changes to scripts and project files. This allows for collaboration and reproduceability, two of the main themes that this technical skill focuses on!
It encourages the open science policies, that promote open access to code and data for transparency and knowledge sharing. This is also great as it means if there is curiosity about the results of research, others can reproduce the data and makesure no biases are involved in the process of the researches findings or claims!

How this actually went for us.....:
The whole class is all pretty new to Git and GitHub, except for some bioinformatics students that have had the experience with bash, git, terminal and other associated aspects we are starting to learn the skills of. 
This meant, we were in a great collaborative environment, where we were able to help eachother out. Due to the nature of the module, with Git being introduced at the beginning, instead of the end like it had in the prior year - this led to a LOT of trouble shooting, issues with software, differences between machines (e.g Macbook, linux and windows.) 

Although time consuming and frustrating, this meant we were able to really implement our time management, critical thinking, problem solving and teamwork within the first two days.

Back to it....
First we will check that everything is connected and communicating!
```{r}
#install.packages("usethis")
credentials::git_credential_ask()
usethis::git_sitrep()
```

As per the workbook instructions, I have now created a Personal Access Token (PAT)
on my account in GitHub. Here it is saved for when I need it!:

Code: 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

What now?:
I have made sure to set a new project, where I have my new script for my repository. I had previously created the cloned and personal versions but will now ONLY USE THIS ONE - to avoid confusion moving forward. 

I have now created a new project, through version control within R, copying and pasting my new repository. I have done a check that it is all connected, by 1.Committing 2. Pushing and 3. Pulling. 

I jumped online to review my repo and it's all there and looks goood. I also checked my folder and path, to makesure that it contains my code, data, output and then the project itself. They're there!!! So we can move forward now with confidence, knowing that any changes I make, will be replicated within either of the programs.


We've covered lots, but I'm gaining more of an understanding the more we put the theory into practice.


Key Actions:
2.11.1 Pull: Syncs local project from remote server (in our case - GitHub). Always save before this to avoid overwriting the file.

2.11.2 Stage: Prepares the files for being committed. Always happens before committing the files, almost like a sort and prep stage.

2.11.3 Commit: The function thast saves the version of the script/project into the repository history locally. The commment section allows us and any other users to know understand what. this comment involved. E.g "Updated changes made for raw data, cleaning and sorting. Now ready for analysis".

2.11.4 Push: The function that sends our locally commited project into the server and synchronises the versions (version control.)

PART 2: Data Visualisation in R


Let's have a looksie at our data!
```{r}
R.version.string
```
Great, we have the current and latest version of R runnning.
```{r Tidyverse}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
```
Install and load tidyverse packages above and then GGplot (ggplot2).

```{r Installing ggplot}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```
Let's start by creating a ggplot! 
A couple notes here for my portfolio!
displ- engine size of the car in litres
hwy - the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance.

We will first do a scatter plot!
```{r Scatterplot}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
```{r Data for plotting}
data(mpg)
# Quick data checks
head(mpg)
glimpse(mpg)
summary(mpg)
```
Creating a plot!
```{r Plot creation}
geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```
The plot shows a negative relationship between engine size (displ) and fuel efficiency (hwy). In other words, cars with big engines use more fuel. What does this say about fuel efficiency and engine size?

When youâ€™re creating a plot, you essentially need two attributes of a plot: a geom and aesthetics.
```{r Load data}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class))
geom_smooth(mappings = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype =drv)) # try smooth line
```
I played around with the different ways of displaying the data and the associated warnings that come up with each of the prompts, in an old R script.
I want to take on board the feedback from the last few modules of refining my script and just do the final and clean versions needed for learning and E-portfolio.

```{r Playing with the plot}
# Change point shape by class:
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))

# Make all points blue
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")

# Change point colour by class:
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, colour = class))
```
Okay great! I'm getting a good handle on my plots now and how to change aspects of the plot to make it look more aesthetic 

2.22 Transformation and Stats
Let's make a barchart.
```{r Start our chart creation!}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```
Looks good, I fixed the mistake (typo xx)
```{r Plotting}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```
In general, we can use geoms and stats interchangeably. See above the stat count second chunk, does the same as our geombar function!

Let's learn some more about data frames: 
```{r Data Frames}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.min = min,
    fun.max = max,
    fun = median
  )
```
```{r Plotting}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, colour = cut))
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = cut))

```
```{r Plotting Diamonds}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```
Oooh! This looks great. I actually know these terms of clarity since looking into my moissannite ring!

The ability to make position adjustments is vital, it allows you to customise your plots in three ways, identity (raw data), fill (changes heights) and dodge (which forces ggplot2 to not put things on top of each other).

```{r Transparency}
#To alter transparency (alpha)
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity)) + 
  geom_bar(alpha = 1/5, position = "identity")

#To color the bar outlines with no fill color
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, colour = clarity)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = NA, position = "identity")
```
```{r Diamonds Clarity}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill")
```
I much prefer the solid colour when compared to the transparent columns...
```{r Diamonds Clarity Plot 2}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "dodge")
```
```{r Jitter Plot}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), position = "jitter")
```
We have used jitter previously, great for visualising some types of data!

Okay let's finish up this template since we have had a good play around to help our understanding of what we can change visually within the plots.

3.0 WORKSHOP 2: We have built a strong foundatio in understanding how ggplot allows us to flexibly build graphs, so now can begin to explore data visualisation more!

3.1 LABELS
```{r Labels}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se.e = FALSE) +
  labs(title ="Larger engines typically correlate with lower fuel efficiency")
```
Very nice!

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    x = "Engine displacement (L)",
    y = "Highway fuel economy (mpg)",
    colour = "Car type",
    title = "Larger engines typically correlate with lower fuel efficiency",
    subtitle = "Two seaters (sports cars) are an exception because of their lower weight",
    caption = "Data from fueleconomy.gov"
  )

```
There's more we can do here... like:
3.2 ANNOTATIONS
```{r}
best_in_class <- mpg %>%
  group_by(class) %>%
  filter(row_number(desc(hwy)) == 1)

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = class)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = model), data = best_in_class, nudge_x = 4.5, nudge_y = 1.5) +
  labs(title = "Fuel efficiency generally decreases with engine size",
       subtitle = "Although the labels overlap, there are ways you can handle that issue if you ever find it a problem. These include using the nudge() function to move your text a certain amount and using other R packages to handle text wrapping etc.")

```
3.3 SCALES

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = class)) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  scale_y_continuous() +
  scale_colour_discrete()
```
3.4 AXIS TICKS

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 40, by = 5))
```
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL)
```
3.5 LEGENDS AND COLOUR SCHEMES
```{r}
base <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = class))

base + theme(legend.position = "left")
base + theme(legend.position = "top")
base + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
base + theme(legend.position = "right") # the default
```

Tip: You can also use legend.position = "none" to suppress the display of the legend altogether!


3.6 REPLACING A SCALE
```{r}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_bin2d() + 
  scale_x_log10() + 
  scale_y_log10()
```
GORGEOUS!!

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv))

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1")


```
```{r}
scale_color_manual()
```

```{r Anoyther plot! Presidential}
presidential %>%
  mutate(id = 33 + row_number()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(start, id, colour = party)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_segment(aes(xend = end, yend = id)) +
    scale_colour_manual(values = c(Republican = "pink", Democratic = "lightblue"))

```

```{r Packages and More}
install.packages('viridis')
install.packages('hexbin')
library(viridis)
library(hexbin)

df <- tibble( # note we're just making a fake dataset so we can plot it
  x = rnorm(10000),
  y = rnorm(10000)
)
ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() + # a new geom!
  coord_fixed()

ggplot(df, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_hex() +
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis() +
  coord_fixed()
```

3.7 Themes 

```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_light()

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_classic()

ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_dark()
```

```{r}
theme (panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
        legend.position="bottom",
        legend.title=element_blank(),
        legend.text=element_text(size=8),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        legend.key = element_blank(),
        legend.background = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_text(colour="black"),
        axis.text.x=element_text(colour="black"),
        text=element_text(family="Arial"))
```

3.8 Saving and exporting your plots
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) + geom_point()

ggsave("my-plot.pdf")
#> Saving 7 x 4.32 in image
```
```{r Read in Data}
read.csv('SharkMeta.csv')
Dat <-("SharkMeta.csv")
View(Dat)
summary(Dat)
head(Dat)
```

3.9 Summary
We explored functions of ggplot using data and designed some great plots!
Now it's time to put into practice, what we have learnt. 
```{r}

```
These colours are beautiful, from the Wes Anderson pallete. I will definitely utilise them in my future plots!

Let's move on to assignment 2!

Using real-world marine data collected as part of the Queensland Fisheries Qfish database to develop a report (r-markdown). For this I will create a new script!

Workshop 3 - Data wrangling in R

4.1 Workshop overview: 
We will learn how to take tabluar data and prepare it for use in plotting, fitting statistical modelling and summarising it to better understand pattens in our data.

4.3 Tidying data using Tidyr
Let's organise some data!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
4.4 Tidy data
Sometimes, we are given data that is not easy for an analysis. 
The form of the data may be inconvenient for data collection/entry... but! We can rearrange the data to a format more appropriate for analysis. This process is called "tidying".

```{r}
table1
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã— 4
#>   country      year  cases population
#>   <chr>       <int>  <int>      <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360
#> 3 Brazil       1999  37737  172006362
#> 4 Brazil       2000  80488  174504898
#> 5 China        1999 212258 1272915272
#> 6 China        2000 213766 1280428583
table2
#> # A tibble: 12 Ã— 4
#>   country      year type           count
#>   <chr>       <int> <chr>          <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999 cases            745
#> 2 Afghanistan  1999 population  19987071
#> 3 Afghanistan  2000 cases           2666
#> 4 Afghanistan  2000 population  20595360
#> 5 Brazil       1999 cases          37737
#> 6 Brazil       1999 population 172006362
#> # ... with 6 more rows
table3
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã— 3
#>   country      year rate             
#> * <chr>       <int> <chr>            
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999 745/19987071     
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000 2666/20595360    
#> 3 Brazil       1999 37737/172006362  
#> 4 Brazil       2000 80488/174504898  
#> 5 China        1999 212258/1272915272
#> 6 China        2000 213766/1280428583
```
Each of these tables that we ust plotted, displays the same data set but on the first table (Table1) is in a tidy format. 
The rules: 1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell.

```{r}
# Compute rate per 10,000
table1 %>% 
  mutate(rate = cases / population * 10000)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã— 5
#>   country      year  cases population  rate
#>   <chr>       <int>  <int>      <int> <dbl>
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071 0.373
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360 1.29 
#> 3 Brazil       1999  37737  172006362 2.19 
#> 4 Brazil       2000  80488  174504898 5.61 
#> 5 China        1999 212258 1272915272 1.67 
#> 6 China        2000 213766 1280428583 1.67

# Compute cases per year
table1 %>% 
  count(year, wt = cases)
#> # A tibble: 2 Ã— 2
#>    year      n
#>   <int>  <int>
#> 1  1999 250740
#> 2  2000 296920

# Visualise changes over time
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(table1, aes(year, cases)) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), colour = "grey50") + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = country))

```

Note: Understanding whether data frame structue is optimal (or in other words: Tidy) is a FUNDAMENTAL skill as a marine scientist.

Now we've got the output we want!!!


```{r}
df <- tribble(
  ~id, ~measurement, ~value,
  "A",        "bp1",    100,
  "B",        "bp1",    140,
  "B",        "bp2",    115, 
  "A",        "bp2",    120,
  "A",        "bp3",    105
)
```

```{r}
df |> 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = measurement,
    values_from = value
  )
#> # A tibble: 2 Ã— 4
#>   id      bp1   bp2   bp3
#>   <chr> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
#> 1 A       100   120   105
#> 2 B       140   115    NA
```
```{r}
df |> 
  distinct(measurement) |> 
  pull()
#> [1] "bp1" "bp2" "bp3"
```
```{r}
df |> 
  select(-measurement, -value) |> 
  distinct()
#> # A tibble: 2 Ã— 1
#>   id   
#>   <chr>
#> 1 A    
#> 2 B
```

```{r}
df |> 
  select(-measurement, -value) |> 
  distinct() |> 
  mutate(x = NA, y = NA, z = NA)
#> # A tibble: 2 Ã— 4
#>   id    x     y     z    
#>   <chr> <lgl> <lgl> <lgl>
#> 1 A     NA    NA    NA   
#> 2 B     NA    NA    NA
```
Then, it fills all the missing values using the data in the input. 
With what we're working on here, not every cell in the output has a correspobding value in the input as there's no third blood pressure measurement for the patient B, so that cell remains empty/missing.

4.5.5 Exercises 
1. Why are pivot_longer() and pivot_wider not perfectly symmetrical?
Let's have a look with the below examples.
```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year   = c(2015, 2015, 2016, 2016),
  half  = c(   1,    2,     1,    2),
  return = c(1.88, 0.59, 0.92, 0.17)
)
stocks %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = return) %>% 
  pivot_longer(`2015`:`2016`, names_to = "year", values_to = "return")


# Pivot_longer() has a names_ptypes argument, e.g.  names_ptypes = list(year = double()). What does it do?
```
The variable types are character which is numeric (year), 
```{r}
names_ptypes
```
```{r}
table4a %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(1999, 2000), names_to = "year", values_to = "cases")
#> Error in `pivot_longer()`:
#> ! Can't subset columns past the end.
#> â„¹ Locations 1999 and 2000 don't exist.
#> â„¹ There are only 3 columns.
```
Why does the above code fail?
The code fails because of the error of the script, asking R studio to make the columns longer, for years that aren't within the data set.
```{r}
preg <- tribble(
  ~pregnant, ~male, ~female,
  "yes",     NA,    10,
  "no",      20,    12
)
```

```{r}
table3
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã— 3
#>   country      year rate             
#> * <chr>       <int> <chr>            
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999 745/19987071     
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000 2666/20595360    
#> 3 Brazil       1999 37737/172006362  
#> 4 Brazil       2000 80488/174504898  
#> 5 China        1999 212258/1272915272
#> 6 China        2000 213766/1280428583
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"))
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã— 4
#>   country      year cases  population
#>   <chr>       <int> <chr>  <chr>     
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999 745    19987071  
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000 2666   20595360  
#> 3 Brazil       1999 37737  172006362 
#> 4 Brazil       2000 80488  174504898 
#> 5 China        1999 212258 1272915272
#> 6 China        2000 213766 1280428583
```
```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
```
Note: The data types in the tables above - both [cases] and [populations] are listed as character types (<chr>). Since the values in the columns are actually numbers, so we want to ask the function separate() to convert them to better types using convert = TRUE. Then they will be listed as integer types (<int>).

```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(rate, into = c("cases", "population"), convert = TRUE)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã— 4
#>   country      year  cases population
#>   <chr>       <int>  <int>      <int>
#> 1 Afghanistan  1999    745   19987071
#> 2 Afghanistan  2000   2666   20595360
#> 3 Brazil       1999  37737  172006362
#> 4 Brazil       2000  80488  174504898
#> 5 China        1999 212258 1272915272
#> 6 China        2000 213766 1280428583
```
cases & population now converted to integer. 

Next, I also need to seperate the last two digits of each year. This will make my data less tidy but will come in handy soon. 
```{r}
table3 %>% 
  separate(year, into = c("century", "year"), sep = 2)
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã— 4
#>   country     century year  rate             
#>   <chr>       <chr>   <chr> <chr>            
#> 1 Afghanistan 19      99    745/19987071     
#> 2 Afghanistan 20      00    2666/20595360    
#> 3 Brazil      19      99    37737/172006362  
#> 4 Brazil      20      00    80488/174504898  
#> 5 China       19      99    212258/1272915272
#> 6 China       20      00    213766/1280428583
```
Now, I want to combine multiple columns into a single column.
```{r}
table5 %>% 
  unite(new, century, year, sep = "")
#> # A tibble: 6 Ã— 3
#>   country     new   rate             
#>   <chr>       <chr> <chr>            
#> 1 Afghanistan 1999  745/19987071     
#> 2 Afghanistan 2000  2666/20595360    
#> 3 Brazil      1999  37737/172006362  
#> 4 Brazil      2000  80488/174504898  
#> 5 China       1999  212258/1272915272
#> 6 China       2000  213766/1280428583


```
Now the year is back into the one column, looks good!
I have had a lot of practice with missing values and NaN, and importing data     so will just skip pass that for now and move onto aspects I need to learn and practice more!

Note: Page 78-94 done seperately as homework exercise.
I will relate back to the skills worked on during these sections, for the assignment and Qfish analysis, later on!

Workshop 4: Spatial Data in R
Using GIS and R together! 

We've got a loooooooong code already, so we'll jump straight into it: 
Installing the packages we need and loading into our library.
```{r}
# install and load your packages
install.packages("sf") 
install.packages("terra")
install.packages("tmap")


#load into R library
library(tidyverse)
library(sf) # simple features
library (terra) # for raster
library(tmap) # Thematic maps are geographical maps in which spatial data distributions are visualized
```
```{r}
remotes::install_github('r-tmap/tmap')
```


5.5 Introduction to the problem:
A little bit of background....
"You finally have a chance to meet one of your academic heroes. On meeting her, she mentions that sheâ€™s read your first PhD paper on zooplankton biogeography. She said she was particularly impressed with the extent of R analysis in your biogeography paper and goes on to suggest you collaborate on a new database she is â€˜working withâ€™.
The database has extensive samples of copepod richness throughout Australiaâ€™s oceans and the Southern Ocean too. She has a hypothesis - that like many organisms, copepod species richness (which is the number of unique species) will be higher in warmer waters than cooler waters. But she needs help sorting out the data.
First and foremost, she wants you to use your skills in R to help develop a map that could help you â€˜get a look atâ€™ whether this hypothesis is worth pursuing"

I have downloaded the data that has a spreadsheet pf copepod species richness from around Aus. Copepods that are perhaps the most complex and abundant animal on earth are a type of zoo plankton, and play an important role in ocean food-webs.
We're working with some hectic data (that also sounds pretty RAW and UNTIDY!)
From a Continuous Plankton recorder (CPR) that is actually used in realo world studies for a lab in Bris. More on this here for later: Australian Plankton Survey: IMOS.org.au, https://imos.org.au/facilities/shipsofopportunity/auscontinuousplanktonrecorder/)

There's 5 items in the zipped folder, but I have added them into my "UpdatedDataSci" folder so I'm not changing around my working directory for this section.

```{r}
#load the copepod data into R studio
library(readr)
dat <- read_csv("copepods_raw.csv")
dat
```
Heck yeah! We have the data loaded in and looking as it should based on the reference of the workflow.

5.7 Data Exploration
Let's Familiarise ourself with the copepod data we have been given!

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(dat) + 
  aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = richness_raw) +
  geom_point()

```
Woah! This looks great but it's not yet an actual map. 
We need to add the critical aspects that a map needs, like the real distances between points (projection.)

Let's have a loo at the richness data: The main variable we will be looking at within the data. We will create a point plot with latitude on the x-axis and richness on the y-axis.
```{r}
ggplot(dat, aes(x = latitude, y = richness_raw)) + 
  stat_smooth() + 
  geom_point()
```
I can definitely notice it looks a little odd in my plot. 
There is a really clear change around the -40 latitude point.... This is a good example of visualising the data in plots to see how it looks. If we were using this data to actually get results that we may be sharing/publishing - then we would be checking the reasoning for this with our collaborator.

```{r}

```
Next: Let's turn the data set into a 'simple features collection'. 
I hadn't downloaded the package yet so lets do that and then turn the data into sdat.
```{r}
install.packages('sf')
library(sf)
```
```{r}

```

```{r}
sdat <- st_as_sf(dat, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), 
                 crs = 4326)
```
5.9 Coordinate reference system
I'm familiar with these, so will jump straight into it!
```{r}
crs4326 <- st_crs(4326)
crs4326 # look at the whole CRS
crs4326$Name # pull out just the name of the crs
[1] "WGS 84"
```
```{r}
crs4326$wkt # crs in well-known text format
```
Let's have a look at what we created with our sdat.
```{r}
sdat

Looks as it is supposed to, great!
We can now start playing with msome mapping!

5.11 Cartography
```{r}
plot(sdat["richness_raw"])
```
```{r}
plot(sdat)
```
Very quirky! 
```{r}
#using tmap
install.packages("tmap")
library(tmap)
```

```{r}
tm_shape(sdat) + 
  tm_dots(col = "richness_raw")
```
Time to customize: 
```{r}
tmap_save(tm1, filename = "Richness-map.png", 
          width = 600, height = 600)
```

For the next step, since we are working with maps, we will now need to add in polygons - which from our experience: We know are stored as shapefiles!
```{r}
aus <- st_read("data-for-course/spatial-data/Aussie/Aussie.shp")
Reading layer `Aussie' from data source 
  `/Users/s2973410/Documents/Code/teaching/spatial-analysis-in-r/data-for-course/spatial-data/Aussie/Aussie.shp' 
  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'
Simple feature collection with 8 features and 1 field
Geometry type: MULTIPOLYGON
Dimension:     XY
Bounding box:  xmin: 112.9211 ymin: -43.63192 xmax: 153.6389 ymax: -9.229614
Geodetic CRS:  WGS 84


shelf <- st_read("data-for-course/spatial-data/aus_shelf/aus_shelf.shp")
```
```{r}

```
